# Formal Method Proofs in Coq

This repository is mainly about writing proofs of certified programs i.e. programs that come with a proof that it meets the desired specifications in `Coq`.<br>
A specification is a formal description of the behavior and properties that a program must satisfy. It defines what the program is supposed to do, often in terms of inputs, outputs, and the relationship between them.<br>
In `Coq` a specification is written using formal logic and mathematical expressions. The process involves writing both the program and its specification, and then using Coq's proof assistant capabilities to formally verify that the program meets the specification. This ensures a high level of confidence in the correctness of the program.<br>
